# Implementation of various Graph algorithms in C++

## Introduction
This document provides documentation for the C++ program implementing various graph algorithms and data structures. The implemented algorithms include Dijkstra, Ford-Bellman, Ford-Fulkerson, Kruskal, and Prim. The program also includes implementations of MinHeap, Queue, and Stack data structures.


## Graph Algorithms:

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm
- [Dijkstra.cpp](src%2FDjikstra%2FDijkstra.cpp)
- **Description:** Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It operates by iteratively selecting the node with the smallest known distance from the starting node and updating the distances to its neighboring nodes. This process continues until all nodes have been visited.

#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- [BellmanFord.cpp](src%2FFord-Bellman%2FBellmanFord.cpp)
- **Description:** The Bellman-Ford algorithm is employed to find the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, even in the presence of negative edge weights. It iteratively relaxes edges, attempting to decrease the distance to each node until no further improvement is possible or negative-weight cycles are detected.

#### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
- [FordFulkerson.cpp](src%2FFord-Fulkerson%2FFordFulkerson.cpp)
- **Description:** The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is utilized to compute the maximum flow in a flow network. It achieves this by iteratively augmenting paths from the source to the sink, increasing the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.

#### Kruskal's Algorithm
- [Kruskal.cpp](src%2FKruskal%2FKruskal.cpp)
- **Description:** Kruskal's algorithm is employed to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. It operates by iteratively selecting the shortest edge that does not create a cycle in the spanning tree until all vertices are included.

#### Prim's Algorithm
- [Prim.cpp](src%2FPrim%2FPrim.cpp)
- **Description:** Prim's algorithm is utilized to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph. It begins with an arbitrary vertex and repeatedly adds the shortest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree, ensuring that the tree remains connected and acyclic.



**Data Structures:**
- [MinHeap.cpp](src%2FMinHeap%2FMinHeap.cpp): Implementation of a minimum heap data structure.
- [Queue.cpp](src%2FQueue%2FQueue.cpp): Implementation of a queue data structure.
- [Stack.cpp](src%2FStack%2FStack.cpp): Implementation of a stack data structure.

**Main Program:**
